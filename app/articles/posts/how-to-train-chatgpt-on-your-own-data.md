ChatGPT is undeniably impressive. It's like having a walking, talking encyclopedia at your fingertips, ready to dish out information on just about any topic you can think of. But here's the thing: while ChatGPT may be a jack-of-all-trades, it's not always a master of your specific business needs.

Imagine you're running a real estate agency and want to use ChatGPT for customer support or property recommendations. You might find that, despite its vast knowledge, ChatGPT doesn't quite grasp the unique aspects of your local market or the specific types of properties you offer. It's like asking a general contractor to design a custom home – sure, they've got a lot of construction knowledge, but they might not have the specific expertise you need.

That's where custom training comes in. By feeding ChatGPT data that's specific to your business, you can create a tailored AI assistant that understands your company inside and out. It's like giving ChatGPT a crash course in your real estate agency, so it can provide more relevant and accurate assistance.

So, how do you go about this custom training? Let's explore two options: Custom GPTs and Typed UI.

## Custom GPTs: The DIY Approach

Think of Custom GPTs as mini, customizable versions of ChatGPT. You can train them to tackle specific tasks by providing them with relevant data. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Sign up for a ChatGPT Plus subscription at chat.openai.com. It'll set you back $20 per month, but consider it an investment in your business's AI future.

2. Once you're logged in, click on "Explore" in the left-side menu, then click on "Create GPT." This is where the magic happens.

3. Give your GPT a name and description that reflects its purpose. For example, if you're creating a GPT to help clients find their dream homes, you might name it "DreamHome Finder."

4. In the interactive editor, provide a prompt that tells your GPT what you want it to do. For instance:

   "I'd like you to serve as a knowledgeable real estate advisor, assisting clients in finding their ideal properties. Your role is to guide them towards homes that meet their specific needs and preferences, ensuring the best possible choices."

5. If there's any additional information your GPT should know, add it here.

6. Click on the "Configure" button at the top of the editor, then click on "Upload files" to feed your GPT the data it needs to learn. In our real estate example, you might upload a text file with information about your current listings, neighborhood guides, and property features.

7. Once you've uploaded your data, click "Save" in the top right corner, choose your visibility settings, and click "Confirm." Your Custom GPT is now ready to go!

8. To test your creation, click on "View GPT" in the drop-down menu and start asking it questions related to the topic you trained it on.

While Custom GPTs are a straightforward way to create a tailored AI assistant, they do have some limitations. They might not seamlessly integrate with your brand's visual identity, and there can be challenges when trying to incorporate them into your existing business workflows. Plus, clients need their own ChatGPT Plus account to interact with your Custom GPT, which could be a barrier.

## Typed UI: The Easier Alternative

If the DIY approach of Custom GPTs seems a bit daunting, fear not! Typed UI offers a more user-friendly alternative for creating custom-trained chatbots.

With Typed UI, you can:

1. Build your chatbot using a simple, intuitive interface – no coding required!
2. Seamlessly integrate your chatbot with your website or app, ensuring a smooth user experience for your clients.
3. Customize your chatbot's appearance and tone to match your brand's unique style and voice.
4. Train your chatbot using a variety of data sources, from property listings to neighborhood guides, ensuring it has the knowledge it needs to assist your clients effectively.
5. Monitor your chatbot's performance with built-in analytics and reporting tools, allowing you to continually refine and improve its effectiveness.

Typed UI takes care of the technical heavy lifting, so you can focus on what matters most: providing your clients with a top-notch, personalized experience.

## The Bottom Line

Custom training is the key to unlocking ChatGPT's true potential for your business. By providing it with data specific to your company and industry, you can create an AI assistant that not only understands your unique needs but can also provide more accurate and relevant support to your clients.

Of course, custom training is not without its challenges. You'll need to carefully curate your training data to ensure it's comprehensive, unbiased, and up-to-date. You'll also want to regularly review and refine your chatbot's performance to make sure it's meeting your business goals and providing a positive user experience.

But despite these challenges, the benefits of custom training are clear. With a tailored AI assistant at your side, you can streamline your business operations, provide better customer support, and gain valuable insights into your clients' needs and preferences.

So, if you're ready to take your real estate agency's AI game to the next level, it's time to start exploring the world of custom training. Whether you choose the DIY route with Custom GPTs or the user-friendly approach of Typed UI, you have powerful options that can help you create a chatbot that truly understands and serves your business needs. Happy training!
